        The player who will move first is randomly determined. In the game, you can notice 3 objects:
        the playing field of the first player, the playing field of the second player and the status bar.

    <string name="rules_description_part_2">
        When 2 identical dices become one line horizontally, vertically and diagonally, then you get a
        bonus, depending on the number of dices in the line. 2 dices will give a bonus of 3 * [dice value];
        3 dices gives a bonus of 5 * [dice value].

    <string name="rules_description_part_3">
        If the opponent has dices with the value of X in the cells on the same vertical and you put the
        dice with the value of X on the same vertical in your cell, then the opponent\'s dices are removed.
        Similar rules apply to the opponent. The game ends when one of the players occupies all the cells
        of his field. The winner is the player who scored the most points after the end of the game.
