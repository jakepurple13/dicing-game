## Rules
In the game against AI, you always start first, in the game against a friend, the first move is randomly determined. At the start of the game, you will be notifyed which player moves first. Before starting the move, pay attention to the status bar, there you can see the points of both players and the dice, which will be installed on the next move. A dice from the status bar is placed in the playing field of the specified player. Before each move begins, the status bar dice is updated to a random value. One dice with a value of X will give X points. If on one horizontal, vertical or main diagonal (diagonal, which contains 3 cells) there are 2 dices with an X value, then you additionally get a bonus of 3 * X; if there are 3 dices, then you additionally get a 5 * X bonus. If you place a dice with a value of X on one line on which the opponent has dices with a value of X, then the dices of the opponent with a value of X on the specified line are destroyed. When one of the players occupies all the cells, the game ends. The winner is the player who received the most points at the end of the game.
